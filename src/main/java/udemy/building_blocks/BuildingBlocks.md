# The environment

## Major components of Java

- to do Java development one needs JDK (Java Development Kit): this is a package which allows you compile an run Java 
applications.

### Key commands provided by JDK

- javac: converts .java source file into .class bytecode
- java: executes a program
- jar: java archive (packing files together)
- javadoc: for documentation

## Java Runtime Environment

- In java 8 and earlier, this was subset of JDK
- JRE allows the user to run Java applications (no compiler)
- After Java 8, one just uses full JDK to run Java applications
